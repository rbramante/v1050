# Visual Technology Visual 1050
The Visual Technology Visual 1050 was an early-1980s CP/M system that employed a 6502 as a graphics co-processor alongside the primary Z80.

This github repo is a small subset of http://v1050.classiccmp.org/ focused on the boot code for both the Z80 and 6502 since github seemed to be an appropriate place to archive these particular assets.

See http://v1050.classiccmp.org/ for more information about the Visual 1050's origins, history, documentation and emulation.
